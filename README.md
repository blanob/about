I'm at the terminal stage of my Bachelor's studies in [Statistical Science at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). My primary interest involves spotting trains at North Queensferry on a rainy day, swimming regularly at London Aquatics Centre, and reading ~~50 Great Coastal Walks of the British Isles Volume 2~~ (though I do enjoy a good coastal walk on a sunny day). I took up Kendo since the start of this October. I take pictures of nature, people and other thingamajigs. I'm a fan of Slavoj Zizek, architecture, languages and linguistics, maps and more.
