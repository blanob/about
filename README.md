# About me

I'm studying statistics, with a bit of financial mathematics on the side, in [Statistical Science at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). I'm still actively trying to figure out what to do with my life. So far, my primary interests involve spotting trains at North Queensferry on a rainy day, swimming regularly at London Aquatics Centre, and reading [*50 Great Coastal Walks of the British Isles Volume 2*](https://www.youtube.com/5VAkReIZo40) (as a side note, I do enjoy a good coastal walk on a sunny day). I take pictures of nature, people and other thingamajigs. I took up Kendo since the start of this October. I like Slavoj Zizek (mostly because of his jokes), foreign languages, and maps.
